# Created by use_targets().
# Follow the comments below to fill in this target script.
# Then follow the manual to check and run the pipeline:
#   https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html#inspect-the-pipeline # nolint

# Load packages required to define the pipeline:
library(targets)
# library(tarchetypes) # Load other packages as needed. # nolint

# Set target options:
tar_option_set(
  packages = c("tibble", "readr", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "plyr"), # packages that your targets need to run
  format = "rds" # default storage format
  # Set other options as needed.
)

# tar_make_clustermq() configuration (okay to leave alone):
options(clustermq.scheduler = "multiprocess")

# tar_make_future() configuration (okay to leave alone):
# Install packages {{future}}, {{future.callr}}, and {{future.batchtools}} to allow use_targets() to configure tar_make_future() options.

# Run the R scripts in the R/ folder with your custom functions:
tar_source()
# source("other_functions.R") # Source other scripts as needed. # nolint

# Replace the target list below with your own:
list(
 tar_target(file, "weight-height.csv", format = "file"),
 tar_target(data, load_hw_data(file)),
 tar_target(height_plot, plot_h_density(data)),
 tar_target(weight_plot, plot_w_density(data))

)
